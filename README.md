# GameBistro_using_GODOT

Welcome to **GameBistro_using_GODOT**! This is a quirky and fun game where you play as a ghost working as a server at a restaurant after death. The restaurant serves as a "final stop" before ascending to heaven. The ghost customers come to the restaurant to receive their final meal, which will bring them joy and peace before their journey to the afterlife.

Your role is to serve food and drinks to these ghostly customers. They’ll randomly order from the menu, and after receiving their meal, they will move on to heaven, having enjoyed their last moment of happiness.

As the levels progress, the time to play shortens, and the menu expands with more complex dishes and drinks, challenging your time management skills.

## Story

In the afterlife, there’s a restaurant where ghostly souls come to dine before making their journey to heaven. This restaurant, however, is not just any ordinary place—it serves as the last station where souls can enjoy a final meal that brings them immense joy and peace. The ghost customers, each carrying their own stories, come to savor their last moments of happiness before ascending to the heavens.

As a ghost server, you are tasked with fulfilling the last wishes of these spirits by quickly serving them the food and drinks they desire. Each meal brings them the serenity and joy they need before they leave this world behind. The faster and more efficiently you serve them, the more souls you help reach their final resting place in peace.

The restaurant’s atmosphere is filled with mystery and calm, but as the levels increase, the pressure grows. The menu expands, time becomes shorter, and you’ll need to be on your toes to keep up with the growing demand of your ghostly customers.

Will you be able to handle the pressure and send every soul to heaven with their final meal? Only time will tell.
